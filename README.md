# Rotten Potatoes

## Objective
Rotten Potatoes is an app that allows users to track and rate all of the TV shows they'v watched. You are able to add show title, network, genre, notable actors, a summary, and of course a rating of each show. There is also an option to drop an image of each show.

## Major Hurdles

I encountered several hurdles while making this app. They included:

- Getting user auth implemented
- Being able to delete a show
- Time constraints

## User Stories

- I want the user to add and enter data for TV shows they have watched or are currently watching
- I want the user to be able to view every show they enter on one list
- I want the user to be able to view the individual details of each show they enter
- I want the user to be able to delete a show if they need to

## Stretch Goals
- I want to implement user auth
- I want the image to render on the page just from the URL
